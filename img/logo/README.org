* This folder contains the project for our logo
Description of files in this directory follows below.

** ./ix-drone-logo-project.svg
This is the main project file, it contains my original imported objects that
I have traced from bitmaps. These layers aren't visible but available to be
able to roll back easily.

*** Text in the logo
The font used in the original layers is [[https://talyz.github.io/talyz-new-roman/][Talyz New Roman]].

The text is then converted from text to objects by using "Object to path".

This way we don't rely on users having [[https://talyz.github.io/talyz-new-roman/][Talyz New Roman]] installed as font.

** ./ix-drone-logo.svg
This file doesn't contain the original imported objects to be a bit smaller
for the user to load.

** ./ix-drone-logo-spin.svg
This is a copy of =./ix-drone-logo.svg= but with some added CSS to spin the
rotors of the drone.

** ./*-white.svg
Files where we've replaced =#ffffff= with =#000000=.
